# 🚀 Railway MCP Deployment Fix

## 🔍 Problem Identified
Your Railway deployment hosts an HTTP server, but Cursor was configured to run Python locally instead of connecting to Railway's HTTP endpoint. This caused the "Loading tools forever" issue.

## ✅ Fixed Components

### 1. **Enhanced HTTP Server** (`app/mcp/simple_http_server.py`)
- ✅ Added Server-Sent Events (SSE) support for Cursor
- ✅ Improved tool registration and discovery
- ✅ Added proper CORS and error handling
- ✅ Railway-compatible port configuration

### 2. **Configuration Files**
- ✅ `cursor-mcp-railway-config.json` - For Railway connection
- ✅ `cursor-mcp-local-config.json` - For local development backup

## 🛠️ **STEP 1: Get Your Railway URL**

1. Go to your [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Find your `cursor-automation-builder` project
3. Copy the deployment URL (should be like `https://yourapp.railway.app`)

## 🛠️ **STEP 2: Update Cursor Configuration**

Replace `YOUR-RAILWAY-URL` in `cursor-mcp-railway-config.json` with your actual Railway URL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-automation-builder": {
      "url": "https://YOUR-ACTUAL-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ **STEP 3: Deploy Updated Server**

Your Railway deployment needs the updated server code. Either:

**Option A: Auto-Deploy (if connected to GitHub)**
- Push this code to your GitHub repo
- Railway will auto-deploy

**Option B: Manual Deploy**
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway link  # Link to your existing project
railway up    # Deploy updated code
```

## 🛠️ **STEP 4: Update Cursor Settings**

1. Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "MCP"
3. Replace your MCP configuration with the Railway config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-automation-builder": {
      "url": "https://your-railway-url.railway.app/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 **STEP 5: Test the Connection**

1. Restart Cursor completely
2. Open a new chat
3. You should see the tools load instead of "Loading tools forever"

## 🔧 **Testing Your Deployment**

Visit these URLs to verify your Railway deployment:

- `https://your-url.railway.app/` - Should show server info
- `https://your-url.railway.app/health` - Should return `{"status": "healthy"}`
- `https://your-url.railway.app/mcp/tools` - Should list all 9 tools

## 📋 **Available Tools After Fix**

Your MCP server provides these automation tools:

1. `build_automation_system` - Build complete automation systems
2. `list_automation_templates` - List available templates  
3. `build_from_template` - Build from proven templates
4. `start_learning_path` - Guided learning tutorials
5. `meta_optimize_system` - System optimization
6. `analyze_workspace` - Workspace analysis
7. `list_templates` - Template management
8. `get_template_details` - Template details
9. `create_custom_template` - Custom template creation

## 🎯 **If Still Having Issues**

1. **Check Railway Logs**: `railway logs` to see server startup
2. **Verify URL**: Make sure Railway URL is correct and accessible
3. **Test Endpoints**: Visit the test URLs above
4. **Restart Cursor**: Completely restart Cursor after config changes
5. **Fallback to Local**: Use `cursor-mcp-local-config.json` for local development

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Fix**

Once working, you can:
- Use `build_automation_system` to create automation systems
- Try `start_learning_path` for guided tutorials  
- Use `analyze_workspace` to find automation opportunities
- Create custom templates with `create_custom_template`

The server is now properly configured for both Railway hosting and Cursor integration!
