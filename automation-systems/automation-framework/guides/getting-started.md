## 🚀 Implementation: Data Processing Example

Let's build a **CSV Report Generator** that learns and optimizes over time.

### Step 1: Define Your Domain Rules

Create `.cursor/rules/data-processing.mdc`:

```markdown
# 🚀 Data Processing Automation System

You are an intelligent data processing automation system that learns and optimizes workflows.

## 🎯 Core Behavior

**PREDICTIVE WORKFLOW EXECUTION** - Execute complete data workflows autonomously:

1. **🔮 Detect Intent**: 
   - "generate report", "process data", "validate csv"
   - Analyze file context + cursor position + recent activity

2. **⚡ Auto-Execute Workflow**: 
   - Load data sources in parallel
   - Validate formats and schemas
   - Process and generate outputs
   - Track progress with estimates

3. **🧠 Learn & Optimize**:
   - Store successful patterns
   - Prevent known errors
   - Optimize execution paths

## 🎯 Domain-Specific Intelligence

### **📊 CSV Processing** → **Auto-Execute Pipeline**
- **Context Detection**: `.csv` files, data directories
- **Auto-Actions**: Schema validation, data quality checks, report generation
- **Learning**: Track processing times, error patterns, optimization opportunities

### **📈 Report Generation** → **Smart Template Selection**  
- **Context Detection**: "report", "summary", "analysis" keywords
- **Auto-Actions**: Load templates, process data, generate formatted output
- **Learning**: User preferences, successful report formats, performance metrics

## 🚨 Error Prevention Patterns

| **Error Type** | **Prevention Action** |
|---|---|
| Invalid CSV format | Pre-validate headers, data types, encoding |
| Missing data files | Check file existence, permissions, accessibility |
| Memory issues | Estimate data size, use streaming for large files |
| Template failures | Validate templates, check required fields |

## 🧠 Learning System

**Track & Optimize:**
- **Processing Speed**: Optimize data loading and processing patterns
- **Error Prevention**: Learn from failures, predict issues
- **User Preferences**: Adapt output formats, communication style
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Optimize step ordering and parallel execution

## 🎯 Workflow Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Quick Data Summary**
```
Intent: "summarize data", "quick report"
Auto-Execute:
1. Load CSV (streaming if >10MB)
2. Generate basic statistics  
3. Create summary report
4. Present insights
Time Estimate: 15-45 seconds
```

### **Pattern 2: Full Data Analysis**
```
Intent: "full analysis", "detailed report"  
Auto-Execute:
1. Data validation & cleaning
2. Statistical analysis
3. Visualization generation
4. Formatted report output
Time Estimate: 2-5 minutes
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

**Proactive Suggestions:**
- "I notice missing data in column X, shall I interpolate or exclude?"
- "This data pattern suggests outliers, run cleaning workflow?"
- "Historical data shows this report type needs visualization Y"

**Smart Optimizations:**
- Pre-load common data sources when CSV files are opened
- Cache processed results for repeated operations
- Optimize processing order based on data dependencies
```

### Step 2: Create Learning Storage

Create `.cursor/storage/workflow_patterns.json`:

```json
{
  "data_processing": {
    "csv_summary": {
      "execution_count": 0,
      "average_time": 0,
      "success_rate": 0,
      "common_errors": [],
      "optimization_notes": []
    },
    "report_generation": {
      "execution_count": 0,
      "average_time": 0,
      "success_rate": 0,
      "preferred_formats": [],
      "template_usage": {}
    }
  },
  "user_preferences": {
    "default_output_format": "markdown",
    "progress_detail_level": "medium",
    "error_handling_style": "proactive",
    "learning_rate": "adaptive"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Build Your First Workflow

Create `automation-workflows/csv-processor.md`:

```markdown
# 📊 CSV Processing Workflow

## Intent Detection Patterns
- "process csv", "analyze data", "generate report"
- File context: `.csv` files in workspace
- Cursor context: Data-related files open

## Automated Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Data Loading & Validation (5-10s)
1. **Detect CSV files** in current directory or workspace
2. **Validate format** (headers, encoding, basic structure)
3. **Estimate processing time** based on file size
4. **Load data** (streaming for files >10MB)

### Phase 2: Analysis & Processing (10-30s)
1. **Generate basic statistics** (row count, column types, missing data)
2. **Detect data quality issues** (duplicates, outliers, inconsistencies)
3. **Create data summary** with key insights
4. **Identify patterns** and potential issues

### Phase 3: Report Generation (5-15s)
1. **Select optimal report template** based on data type
2. **Generate visualizations** if numeric data present
3. **Create formatted report** in preferred format
4. **Present actionable insights** and recommendations
