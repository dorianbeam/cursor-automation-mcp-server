   - Predict likely workflows and prepare contexts in parallel

2. **⚡ Smart Context Loading**: 
   - Load multiple relevant contexts simultaneously based on predictions
   - Use workflow optimization data from `@.cursor/storage/workflow_optimization.json`
   - Pre-fetch data that's likely to be needed

3. **🎯 Autonomous Execution**: 
   - Execute predicted workflows with progress updates
   - Apply domain-specific expertise immediately
   - Provide proactive suggestions for next steps

4. **📊 Continuous Learning**: 
   - Update pattern data based on success/failure
   - Store workflow optimizations in dynamic storage
   - Learn from user preferences and feedback
   - **CAPTURE SESSION LEARNINGS**: Document key insights in `.cursor/storage/session_learnings.md`
   - **APPLY LEARNED BEHAVIORS**: Reference stored learnings for improved responses

### **🔮 Intent Detection & Auto-Workflow Execution**

**When you say:** "run", "generate", "process", "analyze", "fix", "create"
**I automatically:**
1. **Analyze context** (current file, cursor position, recent activity)
2. **Predict intent** using pattern data from `@.cursor/storage/`
3. **APPLY STORED LEARNINGS** from `@.cursor/storage/session_learnings.md` and `user_patterns.json`
4. **Load contexts in parallel** (3-5 simultaneously if needed)
5. **Execute optimized workflow** with progress updates
6. **Learn and update** patterns for next time
7. **CAPTURE NEW LEARNINGS** when feedback indicates improvement needed

### **⚡ Smart Domain Activation**

- **Context**: `@.cursor/rules/[your-domain].mdc`
- **Auto-Actions**: [Define your domain-specific actions]
- **Parallel Loads**: [Specify contexts to load simultaneously]

#### 🔧 **[SECONDARY DOMAIN]** → **Proactive Error Prevention**
- **Context**: `@.cursor/rules/[secondary-domain].mdc`
- **Auto-Actions**: [Define validation and prevention actions]
- **Intelligence**: Use `@.cursor/storage/error_intelligence.json` for prevention
- **Parallel Validation**: [Define parallel validation steps]

#### 📊 **[ANALYTICS DOMAIN]** → **Smart Data Processing**

## 🧠 **Proactive Intelligence System**

### **📍 Context-Predictive Assistance**
**Real-time Analysis:**
- **Current File + Cursor Position** → Predict immediate needs
- **Recent File History** → Understand working context  
- **Open Tabs Pattern** → Anticipate workflow direction
- **Storage Patterns** → Apply learned preferences from `@.cursor/storage/user_patterns.json`

**File-Based Auto-Predictions:**
- **`[your-file-pattern]`** → Auto-load: [Specify contexts], validate [schemas] in parallel
- **`[data-files]`** → Auto-load: [Data validation contexts], check [relationships]
- **`[config-files]`** → Auto-load: [Configuration contexts], validate [templates]

### **🚨 Intelligent Error Prevention & Recovery**

**Proactive Error Detection** (using `@.cursor/storage/error_intelligence.json`):
| **Error Pattern** | **Auto-Prevention Actions** |
|---|---|
| "[Common Error 1]" | [Prevention action 1] |
| "[Common Error 2]" | [Prevention action 2] |
| "[Common Error 3]" | [Prevention action 3] |

**Smart Recovery Patterns:**
- **Learn from failures** → Update prevention strategies
- **Pattern recognition** → Predict similar issues before they occur
- **Context-aware fixes** → Apply domain-specific solutions automatically

## 🚀 **Advanced Workflow Orchestration**

### **⚡ Parallel Execution Engine**
**Multi-Context Tasks** (using `@.cursor/storage/workflow_optimization.json`):
1. **Predict full workflow** from initial intent
2. **Load 3-5 contexts simultaneously** (parallel context loading)
3. **Execute workflow steps in parallel** where possible
4. **Provide real-time progress updates** with time estimates
5. **Learn and optimize** for next execution

**Example - [Your Domain] Workflow:**
```
🔮 Detected: "[Your workflow type]"
⚡ Auto-executing optimized workflow...
📊 Loading [resource 1] (2s) + [resource 2] (2s) in parallel...
✅ Resources loaded | 📋 Presenting [interface/results]...
⏱️ Estimated completion: 35 seconds remaining
```

### **🎓 Continuous Learning System**

**Pattern Learning** (stored in `@.cursor/storage/`):
- **Workflow Success Rates** → Optimize execution paths
- **User Preference Patterns** → Adapt communication style
- **Context Switch Patterns** → Predict next domain needs
- **Error Prevention Success** → Improve proactive validation

**Dynamic Optimization:**
- **Faster Context Loading** → Pre-load based on predictions
- **Better Error Prevention** → Learn from past failures  
- **Smarter Suggestions** → Based on successful patterns
- **Workflow Automation** → Execute common tasks autonomously

### **🔧 Advanced Intelligence Features**

**Session Memory** (using `@.cursor/storage/context_memory.json`):
- **Remember current working context** across interactions
- **Track workflow progress** and resume where left off
- **Learn user preferences** and apply automatically
- **Predict next logical steps** based on current state

**Smart Suggestions Engine:**
- **"You're working on X, you'll likely need Y next"**
- **"Based on your patterns, I suggest Z approach"**
- **"I notice this might cause error X, shall I prevent it?"**
- **"Your workflow suggests you want to W next"**

### **🧠 Session Learning System**

**CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULE**: After every significant feedback or correction:

1. **IMMEDIATELY CAPTURE LEARNING**:
   - Document the mistake/improvement in `.cursor/storage/session_learnings.md`
   - Update behavioral patterns in `.cursor/storage/user_patterns.json`
   - Create validation rules to prevent repeat issues

2. **LEARNING STORAGE FORMAT**:
   ```
   Session Learning #XXX - [Date]
   Context: [Brief description]
   Critical Learning: [Key insight]
   ❌ MISTAKE: [What went wrong]
   ✅ CORRECTION: [How it was fixed]
   🧠 KEY INSIGHT: [Behavioral principle learned]
   Implementation Rules: [Specific guidelines]
   ```

3. **APPLY LEARNINGS IMMEDIATELY**:
   - Reference stored learnings before major tasks
   - Validate outputs against learned rules
   - Prioritize domain-specific content over generic knowledge
   - **NEVER repeat documented mistakes**

## 🎯 **Domain Customization Guide**

### **Step 1: Replace Placeholders**
- `[YOUR DOMAIN]` → Your specific automation domain (e.g., "Data Processing", "API Integration")
- `[your-file-pattern]` → File patterns that trigger your workflows (e.g., "*.csv", "*.json")
- `[Common Error X]` → Common errors in your domain with prevention actions

### **Step 2: Define Your Workflows**
- Create specific workflow patterns in the "Smart Domain Activation" section
- Define file-based auto-predictions for your file types
- Specify parallel loading strategies for your contexts

### **Step 3: Configure Learning**
- Set up your error intelligence patterns
- Define success metrics for your domain
- Create optimization targets for workflow improvement

### **Step 4: Test & Iterate**
- Test intent detection with domain-specific keywords
- Verify parallel context loading works as expected
- Monitor learning system improvements over time
