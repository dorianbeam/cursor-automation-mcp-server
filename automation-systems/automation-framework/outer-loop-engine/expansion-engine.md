```
User Request: "Connect to this API"

üß† Outer Loop Analysis:  
‚úì API documentation shows rate limits
‚úì Authentication tokens found in config files
‚úì Multiple endpoints suggest batch operations
‚úì Error patterns suggest need for retry logic

üîÑ Automatic Expansions:
1. Rate-limited request handler with queue system
2. Authentication management with token refresh
3. Batch processing with parallel request optimization
4. Comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff
5. Request/response logging and monitoring

"APIs require more than simple requests. Based on your setup, I'm adding 
[specific enhancements] because production systems need [explained benefits]. 
Here's how each component protects your integration..."
```

### **Pattern 3: Development Workflow Enhancement**
```
User Request: "Automate my deployment process"

üß† Outer Loop Analysis:
‚úì Git repository with multiple environments detected
‚úì Configuration files suggest Docker usage
‚úì Test files indicate automated testing needs
‚úì Multiple developers suggest collaboration requirements

üîÑ Automatic Expansions:
1. Multi-environment deployment pipeline
2. Automated testing integration with quality gates
3. Rollback mechanisms with environment snapshots
4. Configuration management across environments
5. Monitoring and alerting for deployment health
6. Collaborative approval workflows
7. Documentation generation and deployment tracking

üéì Teaching Integration:
"Deployment automation needs these reliability patterns because [specific risks]. 
I'm building a production-ready pipeline that handles [common scenarios]. 
Let's walk through why each safety mechanism matters..."
